        <p>I am Max, a lion tamer with years of experience in training lions for the circus. I've always been proud of my lions and their exceptional performances, but lately, I've become increasingly frustrated with the growing popularity of tigers.
            Everywhere I go, I hear people talking about how magnificent tigers are and how they are the king of the big cats. I can't understand why everyone is so obsessed with tigers, and it feels like lions are being overlooked and underappreciated.
            
            I've vented my frustrations to anyone who would listen, but no one seems to understand where I'm coming from. I've always known that lions are just as impressive as tigers, and I've been determined to prove it.
            So when I was given the opportunity to work with a group of tigers for the first time, I jumped at the chance. I was convinced that I could train the tigers to perform even better than the previous tiger tamers, and that I could finally show the world the true potential of lions.
            
            The tigers were not like the lions I was used to working with. They had their own personalities and habits, and I soon realized that they required a different much exhausting approach. I struggled to get the tigers to perform the tricks I had taught the lions, and they seemed to resist my every attempt to control them.
            
            ITâ€™S INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING!</p>

        <h2>Why are lions better:</h2>
       
       <ul>
       <li>Lions are pure strength </li>
        <li>A lion is not as cunning and sneaky as a Tiger. </li>
        <li>A lion can display brut force, aggression and tough decisive discipline, but equally sometimes a gentle loving touch and be devoted protectors.</li>
        <li>The roar of a tiger might be as equally loud, but it lacks the resonance and magnificence of a lions rumble. </li>
        <li>Lone Rangers like tigers and leopards are appreciated but not respected. Deep inside humans admire and seek comfort in companionship, authority, strength, cooperation and leadership.</li>
    </ul>
