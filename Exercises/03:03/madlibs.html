        I had the most 
        <span id="adjectiveSpan"> adjective</span> 
        dream last night. There was a 
        <br>
        <span id="verbSpan"> verb</span>  
        <span id="nounSpan"> noun </span>

        <span id="eventSpan"> EVENT </span> 
        behind me! I woke up in a 
        <span id="adjectiveSpan3"> adjective</span>
        state...
